# Oscilloscope Trigger

## Overview

The Oscilloscope trigger is a function that can generate a pulse to an external test device when specific events happen. This feature is useful for monitoring bus events that occur intermittently. This is especially important in 10 BaseT1s because the Beacon is periodically transmitted - this makes it diffcult to use a scopes traditional triggering mechanisms.
