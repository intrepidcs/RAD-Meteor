# 10BaseT1s Test Modes

The specification which defines 10BaseT1s ([IEEE Std 802.3cg](https://standards.ieee.org/search/?q=802.3cg)) specifies specific test mode wave forms to test the PHY. These can be enabled using RAD-Meteor.

There are two ways to enter the test modes. The first is using the buttons and the second is using a [specific setup command](host-usb-commands/) from the host.

## Using Buttons to use Test Modes

Press the "A" button from the main screen to enter the test mode screens. Pressing "A" will enter test Mode 1. Cycle through the test modes by pressing "A" and "B". When done press "X" to exit and return to normal operation (Test Mode Disabled).
