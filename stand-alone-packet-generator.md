# Stand Alone Packet Generator

## Overview

The stand alone packet generator transmits 10BaseT1s messages without the PC. The purpose of this feature is for training, testing, demonstration and evaluation of 10BaseT1s networks.&#x20;

This feature is accessed from the [main screen](display-main-screen/) by pressing the yellow button.&#x20;

Currently you can send packets every 1 ms, flood bus,  burst packets, generate packets at a line rate, send one packet, or generate a specific number of packets. Pressing the green button in the sim mode screen will execute the simulation. The simulation will stay running when you return to the main screen.

There are settings that control the packet generator. These are described in the settings topic.

## [display-setup-screens.md](display-main-screen/display-setup-screens.md "mention")

When the generator is running there will be a toggling slash on the bottom line of the [main screen](display-main-screen/).

**Note: This feature will be made more configurable in the future. Please contact Intrepid for future updates.**
