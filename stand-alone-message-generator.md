# Stand Alone Message Generator

## Overview

The stand alone message generator transmits 10BaseT1s messages without the PC. The purpose of this feature is for training, testing, demonstration and evaluation of 10BaseT1s networks.&#x20;

This feature is accessed from the [main screen](display-main-screen/) by pressing the 'b' button.&#x20;

Currently you can send messages every 1ms, flood bus, or send one message. Pressing b in the sim mode screen will execute the script. The script will stay running when you return to the main screen.

When the script is running there will be a toggling slash on the bottom line of the [main screen](display-main-screen/).

Note This feature will be made more configurable in the future. Please contact Intrepid for future updates.
