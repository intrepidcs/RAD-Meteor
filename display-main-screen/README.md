| ID      | This field configures the node’s PLCA Local ID and the transmit opportunity within the PLCA cycle which it will transmit. A value of zero configures the node as the PLCA coordinator responsible for the periodic transmission of the PLCA BEACON and the number of transmit opportunities available per PLCA bus cycle. When set to 0xFF, the PLCA operation will be disabled and the node will revert to CSMA/CD                                                                                                                                                           | This parameter shall be configured unique across the multidrop network to ensure proper collision-free operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| TO      | Configures the PLCA Transmit Opportunity time allowed for each node to begin transmitting to capture the network. The time is represented in increments of 100 ns (i.e., 1 BT).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Important: This field must be configured identically across all nodes on the multidrop network. Improper configuration of Transmit Opportunity timer may result in reduced network performance or collisions. It is recommended to leave this field at its default value unless a full evaluation of network delays has been performed. |
| Nodes   | This field configures the maximum number of nodes supported on the multidrop network. Proper operation requires that this field be set to at least the number of nodes that may exist on the network. The number of transmit opportunities in a given PLCA cycle. Valid range: 0x01-0xFF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | This field must be configured correctly on the node with ID=0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Burst   | When burst mode is enabled, this field configures the amount of time allowed following the transmission of a frame which the node will continue to transmit and hold the multidrop network waiting for the MAC to transmit an additional frame. Should the timer expire before the MAC transmits an additional frame, or if the maximum number of frames allowed to be transmitted in a single burst has been exceeded, the node will stop transmitting and yield the network to the next transmit opportunity. The time is represented in increments of 100 ns (i.e., 1 BT). | Note: The minimum value should be equal to the MAC inter-frame gap (IFG) plus margin for the latency between the MAC and PHY. IFG is 96 bit times for 10Mbit Ethernet.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Max     | This field configures the maximum number of additional frames that the node may transmit in a single transmit opportunity. When set to 0, the PLCA burst mode is disabled and only one frame will be transmitted per transmit opportunity.r Burst how many frames allowed. 0 means burst is disabled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| TXJAB       | This bit indicates the occurrence of a transmit jabber condition. A jabber condition occurs when the PHY detects that the PCS has remained in the transmit state longer than 2 ms.     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| RXINTO      | This bit indicates the detection of another node transmitting in this node’s local assigned transmit opportunity. This could indicate multiple nodes being assigned the same Local ID. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| UNEXPB      | When configured as the PLCA coordinator in charge of transmitting the periodic coordinating BEACONs, this bit indicates the detection of an unexpected BEACON on the segment.          | This condition may be due to the configuration of multiple PLCA coordinators on the segment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| BCNBFTO     | This bit indicates the detection of a BEACON before the node’s assigned transmit opportunity.                                                                                          | This condition could indicate the configuration of multiple PLCA coordinators on the segment. Other conditions that may cause this to occur include a PLCA coordinator with an incorrectly configured maximum node count resulting in a PLCA cycle that is too short, or a PLCA Local ID that is configured beyond the PLCA cycle. |
| PLCASYM     | This bit indicates the detection of PLCA BEACON symbols when PLCA is not enabled.                                                                                                      | This condition may indicate the local node is operating with PLCA disabled on a segment with PLCA enabled nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
