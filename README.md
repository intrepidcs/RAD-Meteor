# RAD-Meteor

## Overview&#x20;

**Low cost device for interacting with 10BASE-T1s networks.**

Intrepidâ€™s RAD-Meteor is a cost effective means to add a 10BASE-T1S ([IEEE Std 802.3cg](https://standards.ieee.org/search/?q=802.3cg)) port to your computer using USB. In addition to monitoring 10BASE-T1S traffic as if it were a standard Ethernet port, the RAD-Meteor network adapter supports the test modes and wave forms required to test the 10BASE-T1S network. RAD-Meteor also has a built-in full color display to view network activity and monitor the 10BASE-T1S status registers.
